GIT

Developed by Linux team.It is a distributed version control system.

SCM : Software Conguration managment.Or Source code managment.

Version Control :

Different version for different releases.

Earlier people worked with centralised version systesm but now we have distributed one.
In a centralised version you have a working copy and then it is saved on one centralised server.
eg : CVS,SCN
IN GIT whichc is a distributed , there is no thing as a mater repo and everyone has

In SVN : you first take an update do your changes and then commit which will transmit those files into the 
central server.(the repo is only manitned on the centralised server verison control ,history etc).As client you only
get a local copy which you modify and then commit into the server.

IN Git : In this every single developer is going to have thier own sever.All revesion history etc..

Git helps us to create a repo where data is stored in an organised manner.

MOdified : Changed but not commited
Staged :  you have marked a modified file to go into next snapshot version ,achived by git add command.
It is also known as index. git add command
Commited : Commited into the local repo.(.Git directory) git commit -m "message"  
Pushed : pushed into remote repo.

GitHub is an example of remote repo i.e hosting sevice.It is a Git repo with a web interface.
