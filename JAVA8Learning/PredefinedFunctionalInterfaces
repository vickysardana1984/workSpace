TO check some condition java provided some predefined predicate functional interface.
They are all present in java.util.function

Predicate :

Perfrom some conditional check and return true or false based on that conditions
eg check if meployee age is greater than 50 or not.
We can use a prediicate to perfrom conditional check
It contains only one abstract method and name of the method is test.

Interface Predicate<Type> {
	boolean test(T t);
}

You need to specify the type of the argument while creating the predicate.
Predicate<Integer> p = I-> I<10;
System.out.println(p.test(100));

Other examples, check if string length is less than 100, to check if collection is empty.

TO reverse a condition we can use, p.negate().

Predicate Joining.

One abstract method test
3 default methods
and 
or 
negate

ONe static method equals.
