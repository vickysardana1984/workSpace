Anonyms classes//Annonymns Class : Class without a name.

//Wherever there is usage of anonnyms class there is always a chance of replacing it with lambda expression.
//But please note we cannot replace all the annonyms inner classes cannot be replaced.They are not equal.
//Annonyms inner class is more powerful than lambda expression.
Differences

1)If annonyms inner class implments an interface which contains only one method, can be replaced with Lambda
2)We can declare instance valrailbe inside anonyms inner class , this keyowrd will always refer to the 
current inner class object and not the outer class object.To access the outer class object , you need to call
OuterClass.this.x But
This always refer to the current outer class variables only.

Differences

1)Lambda is a function without a name Anony inner class is a class without a name.
2)Ann inner classes can extend abstarct and concrete classes but Lambda expression cannot.
3)Ann inner classes can implement an interface with any number of functions but Lambda can only implement functional interface.
4)We can declare instance variables inside Annon INnerclasses but Lambda only local varialbes.
5)Annon inner classes can be instantiated but Lambda expression cannot be.
6)This always refres to current annonymus inner class object whereas in Lambda it refers to Outerclass object.
7)For annon inner class at the time of copmilation, a seperate .class file is created but not for Lambda.
8)Memory will be allocated on demand, whenever we created object but in lambda object creation is not there hence it is saved inside Method area 
ie. inside permanent memory area.


Method level Local vairables inside the lambda variables are always final.(whether declared or not).if you try to change it you will get a copmile time error.
