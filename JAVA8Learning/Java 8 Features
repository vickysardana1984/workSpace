Specialty of Java 1.8 version.It is a major version upgrade
Three objectives
		To simplify programming using Stream API.Very easily and less code we can mantain requirment. It is more readable as well
		To enable and get benefits of Functional Programming in Java.It does not mean java has become functional programming lang.Just that we are getting benefits 
		of Functional programming by using Lambda Expression.
		To get advantage of multi core processor/to enable parllel processing in Java.More compatible code on multipe core processors for processing improvments.
