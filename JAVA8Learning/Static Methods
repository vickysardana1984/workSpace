Static methods in Java.

Static method are no way related to object similarly interface is also not related to object.

It is used to defined genrally required utility mehods which are not related to object state.These 
methods are utility methods , they can be called by anyone using the interface name.
From Java 8 version onwards static methods are allowed inside interface 
and should compulsory contains implementation.

Default and static cannot be together.

Small Twist : 

Since these are static method they cannot be used directly by the class object implmenting the interface.
They have to be called using Interface name only. eg

Interface intrf{
	public static void m1() {
	syso("testing..").
	}
}
Class impl implements intrf {

	public static void main(String args[]) {
	impl obj = new impl();
	impl.m1() // This is wrong will give compilation error.
	
	}
} 

They are not directly a part of implementation class.


Interface static methods wrt to overriding.

Overriding concept is not applicable for interface static method.you can define the same method in the 
implementing class there is no problem .It is valid but not overriding.

You can also define public static void main method in the interface.Hence we can also run the interface directly 
without an implementing class in java 1.8.
