There is a file hibernate.cfg.xml which will have all the details of the connections.

		<property name="hbm2ddl.auto">update</property>
THe above property is used to tell if all the schemas need to be recreated or updated only.
If a table already exists and you changeyour bean, then it will only updated the existing tables.
But if you keep this properyt as Create then it will drop the table everytime and create new tables.(Never used in production).

You need to tell all your mapping classes which you have kept as entity in yoru java file.


@Entity
It is used to tell if a class needs to be mapped into the database.

@Id 
It is used for creating primary key in the table.

Hibernate can generate primary key on its own (unique).It provides annotation for the same with the strategy.
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)


@JoinColumn
To change the name of the column in the database (different from what you have in Java).

You create session factory,
open new session
then do the trasancations and close the trasacations and close the sessions.
