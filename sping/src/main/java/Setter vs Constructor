IN the earlier version of Spring all mandatory depencies were autowired using constructor , if there is a
depency without which the class could run then the recomendation is to use Setter injection.

Typically these days, now a days niether constructor nor setter is defined in the class so by default 
it will be setter dependecies.

Now a days there is no differences between constructor and setter injection.
